    git checkout develop
    git pull
    # Get latest feature branch.
    git checkout feature/My_Awesom_Feature_Branch
    git pull
    # Find the common merge base of the two branches.
    git merge-base feature/My_Awesom_Feature_Branch develop
    # This will print a hash value, called HASH_VALUE in the following, to the console that has to be used in the following.
    git rebase -i HASH_VALUE
    # Text editor will open and print propose something like the following:
    # pick 1fc6c95 do something
    # pick 6b2481b do something else
    # pick dd1475d changed some things
    # pick c619268 fixing typos
    #
    # Change the proposed output so that the commits will be squashed. I.e. replace all but the first "pick" with "squash":
    # pick 1fc6c95 do something
    # squash 6b2481b do something else
    # squash dd1475d changed some things
    # squash c619268 fixing typos

    # Perform the rebase
    git rebase develop
    # Push the changes.
    git push origin [feature-branch] --force-with-lease
